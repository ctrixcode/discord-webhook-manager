# Discord Webhook Manager - Monorepo

The Discord Webhook Manager is a powerful and intuitive platform designed to streamline and enhance how Discord server administrators and users manage their server announcements and messages. It eliminates the need for manual work, expensive paid bots, or complex custom bot development by providing a centralized, user-friendly interface for all your Discord messaging needs.

This monorepo contains two main applications:
- **`apps/web`**: The Next.js frontend application providing the user interface.
- **`apps/backend`**: The Node.js (Fastify) backend API services.

## Problem Solved

Discord server administrators often face challenges when trying to send custom announcements with unique avatars and usernames. This typically requires:

*   **Manual Work**: Tediously creating and sending messages through webhooks for each announcement.

## Getting Started (Monorepo)

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
-   **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
-   **pnpm** (recommended package manager for this monorepo)

### üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd discord-webhook-manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for the entire monorepo**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables for the backend**
    Navigate to `apps/backend` and copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cd apps/backend
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file with your configuration. Essential variables include:

    **Discord OAuth Credentials:**
    You must create your own Discord application at [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain your Client ID, Client Secret, and set up a Redirect URI.

    **Cloudinary Credentials:**
    You must create a Cloudinary account at [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/) and obtain your credentials.

     **Mongodb Credentials:**
    You need mongodb installed locally or in the cloud. You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or [MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) for a free tier.

    ```env
    PORT=4000
    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/discord-webhook-manager
    NODE_ENV=development
    JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_SECRET
    DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback # Frontend callback URL
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables for the frontend**
    Navigate to `apps/web` and copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cd apps/web
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file with your configuration. Essential variables include:
    ```env
    NODE_ENV=development
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000 # Or your deployed backend URL
    ```
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` should point to your backend API. During local development, this will typically be `http://localhost:4000`.

4.  **Start MongoDB** (if using local installation)
    *   **Recommendation for Windows Users:** For a simpler setup, especially on Windows, consider using **MongoDB Atlas** (MongoDB's cloud service). You can create a free-tier cluster and obtain a connection string. Update your `MONGODB_URL` in `apps/backend/.env` with this connection string.
    ```bash
    # macOS with Homebrew
    brew services start mongodb-community

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo systemctl start mongod

    # Or use Docker
    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
    ```
    *For detailed local installation instructions for Windows, please refer to the official MongoDB documentation.*

### üöÄ Usage

From the root of the monorepo:

#### Development

To run both frontend and backend in development mode (using Turborepo):
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Alternatively, you can run them separately:

**Backend Development:**
```bash
cd apps/backend
pnpm dev
```

**Frontend Development:**
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

#### Production

**Build the entire monorepo:**
```bash
pnpm build
```

## üìà Deployment

This monorepo can be deployed to Vercel.

-   **Frontend (`apps/web`)**: Deploy directly to Vercel, specifying `apps/web` as the root directory. Vercel's native Next.js support will handle the rest.
    *   **Important for Vercel Deployment:** Due to Vercel's default `NODE_ENV=production` setting during builds, you must explicitly set the "Install Command" in your Vercel project settings for the frontend to `pnpm install --prod=false`. This ensures `devDependencies` (like `typescript`) are installed correctly.
-   **Backend (`apps/backend`)**: Deploy to Vercel as Serverless Functions, specifying `apps/backend` as the root directory. Ensure you have a `vercel.json` file in `apps/backend` to configure the build and routing for the API.

# Refresh Token Device Fingerprinting Plan

This document outlines a plan to enhance refresh token security by implementing client-generated device fingerprinting. This method aims to bind refresh tokens to specific client devices, making it harder for stolen tokens to be used from unauthorized locations.

## Goal

To prevent unauthorized use of stolen refresh tokens by verifying that the token is being used from the same device it was originally issued to.

## Approach: Client-Generated Device Fingerprinting

We will generate a unique "fingerprint" on the client-side by collecting various browser and device attributes. This fingerprint will be associated with the refresh token during issuance and validated during subsequent refresh token usage.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Client-Side Fingerprint Generation

1.  **Identify Fingerprinting Libraries/Techniques:**
    *   Research and select a suitable JavaScript library for device fingerprinting (e.g., FingerprintJS, or a custom implementation combining various browser APIs).
    *   Consider attributes to collect:
        *   Browser User-Agent (already discussed, but can be part of the fingerprint)
        *   Screen resolution and color depth
        *   Installed fonts (via Canvas API or font enumeration)
        *   Browser plugins/extensions
        *   WebGL capabilities and renderer information
        *   Hardware concurrency
        *   Timezone and language settings
        *   Canvas fingerprinting (drawing and hashing a hidden canvas)
        *   Audio fingerprinting (Web Audio API)

2.  **Implement Fingerprint Generation:**
    *   Develop client-side JavaScript code to collect the chosen attributes.
    *   Hash the collected attributes to produce a consistent and unique device fingerprint string.
    *   Ensure the fingerprint generation is performed consistently across different browser sessions for the same device.

3.  **Send Fingerprint to Server:**
    *   During the initial login request, include the generated device fingerprint in the request payload.
    *   During subsequent refresh token requests (when exchanging a refresh token for a new access token), also include the current device fingerprint.

### Phase 2: Server-Side Integration

1.  **Modify Refresh Token Issuance:**
    *   Update the authentication service (`src/services/auth.service.ts`) and controller (`src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`) to receive the device fingerprint from the client.
    *   Store the received device fingerprint alongside the `refreshToken` in the database (e.g., in the `AuthSessionToken` model). Add a new field to the `AuthSessionToken` model for `deviceFingerprint`.

2.  **Modify Refresh Token Validation:**
    *   Update the authentication service to:
        *   Receive the current device fingerprint from the client during refresh token requests.
        *   Retrieve the stored `deviceFingerprint` associated with the provided `refreshToken`.
        *   Compare the current fingerprint with the stored fingerprint.

3.  **Implement Fingerprint Comparison Logic:**
    *   **Strict Comparison (Initial):** Start with a strict string comparison. If they don't match, invalidate the refresh token.
    *   **Fuzzy Matching (Advanced):** As an improvement, consider implementing a fuzzy matching algorithm or a tolerance mechanism to account for minor, legitimate changes in device attributes (e.g., browser updates, minor system changes). This can involve:
        *   Comparing individual components of the fingerprint rather than the entire hash.
        *   Allowing a certain percentage of mismatch.
        *   Maintaining a history of recent fingerprints for a device.

4.  **Error Handling and User Notification:**
    *   If a fingerprint mismatch is detected, invalidate the refresh token.
    *   Log the event for security monitoring.
    *   Consider notifying the user about suspicious activity (e.g., via email) and prompting them to re-authenticate.

### Phase 3: Testing and Monitoring

1.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Write comprehensive tests for fingerprint generation on the client-side.
    *   Write unit and integration tests for the server-side logic, covering:
        *   Successful refresh token issuance and validation with matching fingerprints.
        *   Refresh token invalidation with mismatched fingerprints.
        *   Edge cases (e.g., missing fingerprint).

2.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Implement logging and monitoring for fingerprint mismatches to detect potential token hijacking attempts.
    *   Monitor false positives (legitimate users being logged out) to fine-tune the fuzzy matching logic if implemented.

## Considerations and Trade-offs

*   **User Experience:** Overly strict fingerprinting can lead to legitimate users being logged out due to minor device changes. A balance between security and usability is crucial.
*   **Privacy:** Be transparent with users about the data collected for fingerprinting.
*   **Maintenance:** Fingerprinting techniques may need to be updated as browsers evolve or new anti-fingerprinting measures are introduced.
*   **Complexity:** This approach adds significant complexity to both client-side and server-side authentication logic.
